# Vision

There are several roadmapping tools - paid and open source, you can an idea here: https://www.opensourcealternative.to/alternativesto/canny

All of them require paid plans or hosting them on your server - both of in the end cost for running a database + server - it means maintenance.

We can solve this problem by using a Github Repo (Or even Gitlab Repo) - private or public. The idea would be to integrate Github APIs and build a static website.

The list of features we can build:

- Github Projects: Roadmaps
- Github Issues: Issues
- Github Releases: Changelog
- Github Discussions: Feature Requests & Help (Manage with Tags)
- Github Actions: Build the website

## Stack

- NextJS (Make it a monorepo with "themes" folder)
- Tailwind V4
- Github API
